Medical diagnosis tool 

This is a skeleton repository. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

Currently, this project exists to teach my friends how to program in python. The tests have been written for simple fucnctions used to score a depression test and I am waiting for them to implement them.

After they complete this, I want to turn this tool into an expert system for diagnosing medical illness. Similar to WebMd but better with machine learning and the latest developments in medicine.
