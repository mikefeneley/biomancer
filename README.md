Medical diagnosis tool 

This is a skeleton repository. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

Currently, this project exists to teach my friends how to program in Python. The tests have been written for simple functions used to score a depression test and I am waiting for them to implement the functions.

After they complete this, I want to turn this tool into an expert system for diagnosing medical illness. Similar to WebMD. I want it to include machine learning to improve diagnosis abilities and be able to parse medical journals for the latest developments in the field and use that to improve its software. Lofty, I know.
